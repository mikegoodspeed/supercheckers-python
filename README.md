Supercheckers is a board game first published in 1986 by 
[Christopher Wroth](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/2937/christopher-wroth) branded as 
[King's Court](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5157/kings-court) and published by 
[Golden](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/247/golden), 
[MW Games](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/25852/mw-games), 
[Western Publishing Company](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/5700/western-publishing-company).

Rules
-----

*(From [Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5157/kings-court))*

The board is 8x8. The central 4x4 area forms the King's Court. The starting setup places the X and O pieces on the 48
squares surrounding the Court. The opening two moves have both players enter a piece onto the Court from opposing sides
(no jumping yet).

From that point on, a piece must be present on the Court at all times - otherwise the player loses. Pieces move as in
[Checkers](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2083/checkers) except they all move as Kings (no restrictions on
direction). Jumps are again as in [Checkers](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2083/checkers), except that you can
jump your own pieces as well (without capturing them, of course).

Installation

You will need at least version 3.7 of [python](https://www.python.org) and 
[pipenv](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/) to play. 

1. To install `python3` and `pipenv`, use [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) for 
[macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/).

    ```shell script
    $ brew install python@3
    $ brew install pipenv
    ```

2. Confirm which version you have.

    ```shell script
    $ python3 --version
    ```

3. Clone the repository.

    $ cd supercheckers-python
    ```

4. Create the virtual environment.
